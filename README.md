How to make this work:

1) You MUST be using the most current version of Live! (as of this writing, version 10.0.4).

2) Download this repository.  Put the “m4m8” or “m4m8-master” folder
inside Max’s packages folder:  ~/Documents/Max 8/packages

3) Copy all the FOLDERS* from inside the m4m8/Python Scripts/ folder to Live’s MIDI Remote Scripts folder.
(The individual scripts require the "aumhaa" and "Debug" folders in order to work)

4) If you are using a Livid controller, you'll also want to copy all the FOLDERS* from the
m4m8/Livid Python Scripts/ folder to Live's MIDI Remote Scripts folder.

Notes:

I am currently working on new Max8/Live10 compatible versions of m4l devices, as they are finished I will push them to this repository.  

Some of the devices that used to be included in m4m7 (along with some new ones) are getting overhauled and republished.
These include aumboids, endcoders, hex, jove, plinko, and skin.  Keep an eye out, I'll be looking for beta testers soon :)
The other stuff will slowly show back up here as I have a chance to update a bit and weed out any superfluous files that were living in m4m7.

Commissioned scripts will be getting a new repository as I have a chance to go through them and update (also for thinning purposes).

(* Make sure you copy ALL THE FOLDERS FROM INSIDE the "Python Scripts" and "Livid Python Scripts" folders, not the "Python Scripts" or "Livid Pythons Scripts" folders themselves!)

If you find issues, please log it in github or send me an email directly.
